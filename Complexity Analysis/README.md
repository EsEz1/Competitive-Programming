# Complexity Analysis consist of two types:
1. Time Complexity: Quantify the amount of time that's taken by an algorithm
2. Space Complexity: Quantify the amount of space that's taken by an algortihm
# Time Complexity
- The efficiency of an algorithm is important in competitive programming. It's easy
to desgin an algorithm that solve the problem slowly but a real challenge is to invent
a fast algorithm. it indicate how much time will the algorithm use for some input.
# Calculations rule
- The time complexity of an algorithm denoted by O(...) which represents some function
usually, the variable n denotes the input size for example: if the input is an array of
numbers, n will be the size of array, and if the input is a string, n will be the length 
of the string.
