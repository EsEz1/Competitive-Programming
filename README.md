# Introduction
- Competitve Programming combine two topics:
1. The design of algorithm: 
- Consist of problem solving and mathematical thinking. Skills for analyzing problems and solving them are needed.
3. The implementaion of algorithm: 
-Requires good programming skills. The solutions are graded by testing an implemented algorithms using a set of test cases
