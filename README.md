# Introduction
- Competitve Programming combine two topics:
1. The design of algorithm:consist of problem solving and mathematical thinking.Skills for analyzing problems and solving them are needed.
2. The implementaion of algorithm: requires good programming skills.The solutions are graded by testing an implemented algorithms using a set of test cases
