# Introduction
- Competitve Programming combine two topics:
1. The design of algorithms: 
- Consist of problem solving and mathematical thinking. Skills for analyzing problems and solving them are needed.
2. The implementation of algorithms: 
- Require good programming skills. The solutions are graded by testing an implemented algorithms using a set of test cases.
